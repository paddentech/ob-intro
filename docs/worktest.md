### Developer Relations Work Test 

#### Cross-Chain Swap Using OneBalance API

Estimated Time: 4 hours
Skill Focus: API Integration, TypeScript, Developer Communication

##### Objective
Your task is to integrate the OneBalance API into a simple TypeScript-based 
application that demonstrates a cross-chain swap. You will document your 
process and record a short demo explaining your implementation.

Task Breakdown
1. API Integration (2-3 hours)
    Set up a TypeScript-based project (Node.js, Express, or any frontend framework). Use the OneBalance API to perform a cross-chain swap between two testnet assets. Handle authentication, request formatting, and API responses correctly. Display or log the transaction details.
1. Publishing (30 minutes)
    Write a short blog post or Twitter thread draft explaining the integration.
    Explain key API calls and how they interact.
1. Demo Recording (30 minutes)
    Record a 3/5 minute video explaining:
        How the integration works.
        Key challenges faced and solutions.
        A live demo of the cross-chain swap.

### Submission Requirements
* A GitHub repository with:
 * Source code (TypeScript).
 * A short demo video link (Loom, YouTube, or Google Drive).

* API keys should not be hardcodedâ€”use .env  files.
* Ensure error handling and logs provide useful information.
